Execute the following steps:

    Go back to the dev branch:

    Erik@Server:~/myproject$ git checkout dev

    Merge the branch to dev by creating a new commit object:

    Erik@Server:~/myproject$ git merge --no-ff featureBranch

    Delete the branch (the branch explains a feature that is now part of the dev branch, so there is no reason to keep it):

    Erik@Server:~/myproject$ git branch -d featureBranch

    Push your changes on the remote dev repository:

    Erik@Server:~/myproject$ git push origin dev
